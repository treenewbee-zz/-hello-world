Hello Mr. Manba
Yesterday, Manba out, forever, I feel so sad, though i was not your fans. 
I have seen a lot of games you against to my favorite player T-mac, you use your spirit and performance convinced me.
You are a legend and one of the greatest players in NBA.
What a pity to everyone that like NBA and basketball in the world!
